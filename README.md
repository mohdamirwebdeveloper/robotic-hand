# 🤖 Robotic Arm – Dual Interface Automation System

A major engineering project focused on creating a smart robotic hand with 4 degrees of freedom, designed to simulate a factory environment with moving belts and item interaction. This system highlights India’s push toward affordable automation by combining embedded systems with modern web technologies.

## 🎯 Project Overview

In a world where industrial automation is still out of reach for many, this project introduces a **cost-effective robotic hand** designed for small-scale industries, educational purposes, and prototyping.

The robotic system is controlled using two synchronized interfaces:

- A **Web Interface** accessible on any device within the network  
- A **Custom OLED Console** built with an ESP12F microcontroller

It is fully programmable, customizable, and modular — making it suitable for real-world factory simulations or specific automation tasks.

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ **4-Axis Robotic Arm** for flexible object manipulation  
- 🌐 **Web-Based Control Panel** (Pre-programmed motions + Manual axis control)  
- 🖥️ **OLED Display Console** with interactive interface and bitmap graphics  
- 🕹️ **Dual Interface Architecture** – Use OLED or Web interface interchangeably  
- 🔁 **Pre-programmed Motions** – Dance, Rotate 180°, High Five, Demo, etc.  
- 🔧 **Fully Reprogrammable** – Adaptable for new tasks or factory setups  
- 🧩 **Custom Hardware** – Built around the ESP12F with SSD1306 OLED and 3-button control
